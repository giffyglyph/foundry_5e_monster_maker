# TODO

## Major

* Foundry v12 compatibility (as v12 becomes more stable)
* dnd5e 3.*.* updates as needed

## Visual

* Should proficiency show still under Attributes?
* Several attributes don't display or function correctly when under the effects of a DAE
	* Initiative
	* Attack bonus
* Some of the wording of targeting is incorrect now with the field changes. Specifically "enemies within 5 feet", that sort of thing.

## Module Ecosystem

* Custom DAE hooks for scalar stats

## Data Entry

* Ability Modifiers should be high/medium/low rather than ranking, or at least display that way

## Compendiums

* Fixes for typos/misconfigurations/etc that likely exist.
* More examples and elements will be added to the attacks compendium.

## Modal/Info Updates

* I'm sure there's lots!
* Remove unused localization entries referring to deprecated data
* Rename localization entries based on new uses
* Consolidate duplicate attack_bonus + proficiency modifiers
* Deprecation: Update ability_modifiers to have ability + check

## Automation

* MidiQOL effects for deferral timers

## Known Bugs



## Testing Stuff

* The new compendiums need testing!
